            <h1 id="date">January 2016 – Current</h1>
            <p class="lead">Currently at Ford Motor Company I work in the Body Shop Department assembling the Ford Super Duties, F-series, Explorers, and Lincoln Navigators. I complete various tasks, which includes; performing complex and advanced assembly of a vehicle according to established specifications and instructions. Checking and making adjustments for any defects to ensure the vehicles are high quality. Stocking materials and supplies to avoid material shortages, while maintaining a clean, safe and orderly work area. I also perform tasks that require heavy lifting and working long hours doing the same monotonous work. I discover preventive maintenance procedures to avoid any breakdowns and failures that may slow down production and using welding equipment to weld parts together. Already during my time at Ford Motor Company I have trained a few new employees on a multiple jobs and have made it my duty to learn and master new assembly skills on various jobs and departments around the plant.</p><br><br>

            <p class="lead">Working with the Software Team my job is to wipe data from the devices and restore them back to their factory settings.

As FQA, I have to verify the devices and assure that they meet the requirements to move on to the sales department.</p><br><br>

        <p class="lead">I applied software and updated all of the systems at the company. I made edits and designed print ads, web banner ads, social media ads, banner shade ads, billboard ads, program books, brochures and developed and because I was the only employee who could build Joomla websites, I maintained a few CMS websites internally for the company and externally for clients. I provided the new business team with physical copies of our capabilities books in a short period of time and stayed well over time, if needed. Working with the production team I delivered and executed new ways to present the company by using new presentation software and coming up with an idea to turn our physical capability books into a digital book to embed into our website and to email out.</p><br><br>

        <h1 id="date">January 2012 – October 2012</h1>
        <p class="lead">I applied software and updated all of the systems at the company.  Because I was the only designer and developer at the company, I designed and developed internal and external marketing products for the new business managers, for example digital marketing books, mockup websites, and presentations. Working with the production team I delivered and executed new ways to present the company with printable and digital capability books, in-house. Since then, Mo’ Better has acquired New West.</p><br><br>
